          ðŸ“¢ <strong>Important Message for All Students</strong><br><br>
          Dear Visitors,<br><br>
          I want to share something important with you all. During the exam, my photo was taken while I was writing on the table â€” and it might appear in the official snapshot. I deeply regret this and want to be honest with everyone who visits this website.<br><br>
          Please learn from my mistake.<br>
          Avoid writing anything on the table or doing anything that can be seen as unfair during exams. It may seem small, but it can affect your reputation and future.<br><br>
          Use the study material here to prepare well in advance.<br><br>
